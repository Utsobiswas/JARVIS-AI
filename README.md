# JARVIS-AI
Jarvis AI is a personal assistant project built in Python, inspired by Iron Manâ€™s J.A.R.V.I.S. It can interact with users through voice/text commands, answer queries, perform basic tasks, and can be extended with more advanced AI features like natural language processing, data prediction, and automation.
